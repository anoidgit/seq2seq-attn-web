* <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzhmYioWLRn_aEVnd0ZNcWd0Y2c">English <-> German model</a>

Trained on 4 million sentences from
[Workshop on Machine Translation 2015](http://www.statmt.org/wmt15/translation-task.html).

These models are 4-layer LSTMs with 1000 hidden units and essentially replicates the results from
[Effective Approaches to Attention-based
Neural Machine Translation](http://stanford.edu/~lmthang/data/papers/emnlp15_attn.pdf),
Luong et al. EMNLP 2015.
